This project focuses on addressing the removal of pharmaceutical pollutants from wastewater, a growing environmental challenge with serious implications for human health and aquatic ecosystems. Biochar, derived from waste materials, shows promise as a cost-effective and eco-friendly adsorbent for these pollutants. The study aims to evaluate biochar's effectiveness compared to other adsorbents, determine optimal adsorption conditions, and analyze how biochar properties influence its performance. Additionally, publicly available software will be developed to predict biochar's effectiveness.
This research promotes sustainable access to clean water by tackling pharmaceutical pollution. It supports innovative, eco-friendly solutions for water quality improvement and waste valorization, contributing to public and environmental health.
The input variables are TP, Temp, Time, PS, BET, PV, C, H, N, and O. The output is Adsorption Capacity (Qm).
